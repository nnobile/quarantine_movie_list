# Authors and acknowledgment
- This application is accessing data made available via The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/). A word about The Movie Database:

The Movie Database (TMDb) is a community built movie and TV database. Every piece of data has been added by our amazing community dating back to 2008. TMDb's strong international focus and breadth of data is largely unmatched and something we're incredibly proud of. Put simply, we live and breathe community and that's precisely what makes us different.
